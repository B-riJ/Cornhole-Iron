# Cornhole-Iron
For our first project, we constructed a game utilizing JavaScript to simulate animation effects.

#Inspiration 
The games I enjoy most are the ones that create a fun and competitive interaction with all players. At the campus for Ironhack there is 
the infamous backyard game known as cornhole. This is the game that broke the ice between us green students and build those new friendships
in the process. And so I designed my game to replicate the cornhole game with a added wild card element. 

#Controls
The player has the ability to control the sandbag that is tossed towards the cornhole target. To make the game more interesting the 
cornhole board is moving in a loop left and right within the Canvas border. 

Left: left arrow
Right: right arrow
Shoot: Spacebar 

#Score 
The score structer is less strict due to the times we play cornhole are on our 15 minute breaks. A casual system of best out of 3 tosses for
each player is the liberal scoring structure- the emphasis for the our first project was to focus on the building aspect and mastering the
essentials of canvas and JavaScript.
